## Getting Started

To view the documentation locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SystemCAERUS-Documentation.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm run docs-dev
   ```

   This will launch a local development server and provide you with a URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`) where you can view the documentation in your web browser.

## Building the Documentation

To build the documentation for production, run the following command:

```
npm run docs-build
```

The built files will be generated in the `docs/.vitepress/dist` directory.

## Serving the Built Documentation

If you want to serve the built documentation locally, use the following command:

```
npm run docs-serve
```

This will start a server and allow you to access the built documentation through a local URL (usually `http://localhost:5187`).
