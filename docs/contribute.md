    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/SystemCAERUS.git
    ```

3. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your contribution. It is recommended to give the branch a descriptive name that reflects the nature of your contribution.
    ```
    git checkout -b my-contribution
    ```

4. **Make Changes**: Implement the desired changes or additions to the codebase. Ensure that your changes adhere to the project's coding conventions and best practices.

5. **Test Locally**: Test your changes locally to ensure they function as intended. Run the necessary tests and perform any required debugging.

6. **Commit and Push**: Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message explaining the purpose of your contribution. Then, push the changes to your forked repository.
    ```
    git commit -m "Add my contribution"
    git push origin my-contribution
    ```

7. **Create a Pull Request**: Navigate to the original SystemCAERUS repository on GitHub and create a pull request (PR) from your branch. Provide a detailed description of your contribution and any relevant information or context.

8. **Review and Iterate**: The project maintainers will review your PR and provide feedback. Address any requested changes or improvements iteratively. Engage in discussion and collaborate with the maintainers to refine your contribution.

9. **Merge and Deploy**: Once your PR has been approved, it will be merged into the main branch. The changes will be deployed to the appropriate environments, ensuring they are reflected in the live software.
